# higherOrderFunctions
Examples on arrays and objects (with HTML file to test): filter, map, sort, reduce. With loop, ES5, and ES6 arrow functions and some ES6 template strings syntax for variables. 
They say when you know functions, you become dangerous so use this info for good and not evil and
at your own risk. Functions need to be learned by more people because there is an astronomical amount of work that needs to be 
done in the tech field so I accept zero responsibility for any laws broken with the use of these and
I will try to find a good article on all the federal laws as well as new laws you can break as a hacker/cracker in an effort
of making this more exciting!
